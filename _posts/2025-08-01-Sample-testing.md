You’re staring at ChatGPT. You’ve done this a hundred times before: typed a question, copied a response, pasted it into some half-built project or document. Maybe it helped. Maybe it wasn’t quite what you were looking for.

But here’s the thing no one tells you: that chat box you’re using? It’s not the product. It’s the demo.

The real magic - the stuff behind the AI-powered apps everyone’s talking about - doesn’t come from your browser-client, it lives in the API.

It’s not as complicated as it sounds. If you can write a prompt, you’re already halfway there. In this beginner-friendly guide, we’ll explore how we can get started building simple AI-powered apps using your Large Language Model (LLM) of choice. We’ll see how using an API changes the game, and helps us level up our prompts — no machine learning PhD required.
